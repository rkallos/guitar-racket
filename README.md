guitar-racket
=============

Tool for visualizing notes on stringed instruments. It curerntly supports visualizing scales on guitars in standard tuning.
It will eventually support:
* Arbitrary numbers of strings, frets, and tunings (violin, viola, cello, bass, ukulele)
* Arpeggio/chord shape (currently supports scales)
* Sound playback (long-term goal)

This project is inspired by [Mingus, a music library written in Python](http://code.google.com/p/mingus/)
